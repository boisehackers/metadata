We meet Wednesdays from approximately 5-9pm in different locations around downtown Boise.

======================

#### What

A gathering of entrepreneurs and hackers who meet-up and work together on their software products/projects/startups.

#### Why

Talking, learning and meeting are good, but doing is better. Boise Hackers is about getting things done: Experiment. Iterate. Learn. Do cool stuff. Launch.

#### Who

Boise Hackers is for anyone who:

- is working on a software startup/project/product with a goal of turning it into a sustainable business
- wants to develop their software development skills in a largely self-directed manner, but with the support and camaraderie of others in the community.
- wants to help strengthen our community by providing mentoring and guidance to hackers and entrepreneurs.
- wants to get stuff done

We're ad-hoc, which means no formal planning committee or agenda. Bring what you want to work on.

#### When

Weekly, 5-9ish.

No obligation to attend every week, come as often as you like and stay for as long as you like.

#### Bring:

- A laptop
- Something to hack on

#### Where

A coffee shop or similar in downtown. Once we get some traction we will find a bigger space. 
Desired attributes:

- Public to create visibility & a sense of "hacker culture" downtown.
- Somewhere with beer wouldn't hurt.
- Good internet access & power strip availability
- A variety of seating/table options, from small to conference table size
